## How to run this project ‚ùì

### First step

Clone this project to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dungngminh/lets_blog_compose_multiplatform.git
```

This project includes 4 run configurations:
  - `composeApp`: Run Android app
  - `iosApp`: Run iOS app
  - `WebApp`: Run Web app
  - `DesktopApp`: Run Desktop app

### Prepare env configuration

- *Currently, I filled env for KotlinConf contest, you can use it for testing in `env.contest.properties`.*
- If you want to run this project, with your own configuration, you need to create env properties file, I also put a sample file is `env.sample.properties`, you can copy it to `env.properties` and fill your own configuration. Currently, source code is filled with `env.contest.properties` file, you can change it in `build.gradle.kts` file at `buildKonfig` block in `composeApp` module.
